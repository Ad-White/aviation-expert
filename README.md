This website features a game consisting of knowledge, skill and luck.

A fun guessing game where a player is given a number of attempts to try and select the tile of their choice using the random tile selector.
Once the player selects a tile it disappears, revealing a portion of a larger image featuring an aircraft, hidden behind the tiles.
The player is then prompted to enter their guess as to the name of the aircraft being obscured. Or to skip and try again, by selecting another tile to reveal.
This continues until the player has used all their allotted attempts. At which point it's game over.
If the player guesses correctly, a message of congratulations is displayed, and an option of continuing to another level is offered.
At present the game features three levels. As the levels progress the number of attempts on offer reduce, adding an extra layer of difficulty.
If the player succeeds to guess all three aircraft correctly, they have completed the game.

The idea for this project is the result of a conversation with my brother, Matt.
He was describing a game to me. One I hadn't heard of at the time, called Cardle, a daily car quiz.
Here is a link to that game...  [Cardle](https://cardle.uk/).
He wanted to know whether it would be possbile to make something like it but for aircraft. 
As that's one of his passions and would like to play a game along those lines.

During my brothers description of the game, the interpretation I was having in my mind was different to the actual game he was describing.
In my mind the game featured what is now the tile selector of this game.
I have also developed this game differently, by trying to make it more like a game appplication.
Featuring levels, and those levels containing an element of difficulty by reducing the number of attempts a player can have.

I hope you enjoy the game!


## User Experience (UX)

My intended and expected audience, (aside from my brother), will mainly consist of family and friends.
Therefore an audience with knowledge of aircraft from zero to enthusiast.

I have made this game hoping to provide a fun, not too serious game of identification of aircraft.
I have intended to make it simple and easy to use, so as to be both a playable and enjoyable experience.
With consideration to my expected audience, the aircraft I have chosen to include are generally well known.
Also, the accepted answer has been kept relatively short and not overly precise.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

I have chosen a simplistic yet bright colour scheme. One of primary and secondary colours.
These will be used against a silver coloured background to provide good contrast and give a colourful, overall appearance.
My intention is for this to help clearly distinguish the game board of tiles from the background, and the gameboard from the players control buttons and text input.
I have chosen what I hope to be colours that will be intuitive for the player to use as the main game controls.

- `#c0c0c0` - silver - used for background.
- `#0000ff` - blue - used for game tiles.
- `#0000ff` - blue - used for primary text.
- `#ffffff` - white - used for button text.
- `#008000` - green - used for start button.
- `#ff0000` - red - used for stop button.
- `#ffa500` - orange - used for the guess / skip button.
- `#800080` - purple - used for next level button.
- `#0000ff` - blue background + `#ffa500` - orange text - used for quit and continue buttons.

### Typography
 
 In keeping with a clean and simple feel to the site. Also, in order to offer a high degree of readability.
 I have opted for an Open Sans typeface.

- [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) was used for the primary text across the site.
